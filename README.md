# I present to you, the WEBMINATOR
I present to you my latest and greatest invention: the Webminator! With this, I will compress all of the Tri-State Area's short video clips to an unbelievably teensy-weensy size! but no really, This script is designed to compress short video clips (around 1 minute or less) to a target size of 1.9MB or under.

# Prerequisites
Ensure you have ffmpeg installed on your system. If not, download and install it from [here](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html). Remember to add it to your system's PATH so the script can access it.
# Usage
* Select a short video clip that you want to compress.

* Drag and drop the video file onto the compress_video.bat script.

* The script will process the video, and once completed, you will find a compressed .webm file in the same location as the original video.

# Important Note

The script is optimized for short clips of around 1 minute or less. Using it for longer durations might result in the output file exceeding the 1.9MB limit.

# Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues or errors during the compression process, the script will pause to display relevant error messages. Review the provided messages for insights into the problem.

# Notes
* For best results, record on a stage with minimal movement (training mode in most games are optimal)
* Working on the ability to specify times and disable audio, coming soon
